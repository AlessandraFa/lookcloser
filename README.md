# Look Closer
Look Closer is a project created for the Laboratory course taught by Professor Francesca Tomasi during the academic year 2021/2022 as part of the Master's Degree in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. The website showcases the project, which integrates three topics covered in the course.


## Storytelling
The Look Closer project features a story that follows the classic Three Acts structure of storytelling, which was introduced in the second part of the course by Professor Federico Meschini. Titled "Look Closer," the story is presented using Twine software and follows archivist Nina's journey to uncover her past.

## Object digitisation with 3DFZephyr
Using the concepts and examples presented by Prof. Daniele Ferdani in the fifth part of the course, a 3D model of an object was generated using 3DF Zephyr software. To capture the required images, a Nikon D610 camera was utilized to take 113 photographs while rotating the object on a platform within a lighting studio constructed at home. The resulting 3D model was integrated into the story to enhance the narration and provide an engaging interactive experience.

## 3D model with Blender
To create a 3D model of an abandoned house and its surrounding landscape, which is a significant location in the story, I used Blender, an open-source software for 3D creation. The model was developed by following various tutorials and adjusting its appearance to suit the narrative.
