## Object digitisation with 3DFZephyr
The concepts and examples provided in the fifth part of the course by Prof. Daniele Ferdani have been applied to produce three 3D models of three different objects using the software 3DFZephyr.

## 3D model with Blender
The open source software Blender was used to build a 3D model of a landscape, one of the locations of the story.
